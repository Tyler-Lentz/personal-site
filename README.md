# Tyler's Personal Portfolio Site

This website was originally designed as part of a series of homework assignments for CSE 134B at UCSD. In it, we methodically built from the ground up a personal resume website. We started with semantic HTML, and moved our way up into CSS and JavaScript. In the final assignment of the course, we used Firebase to create a simple CRUD application (this blog). 

I hope that this website demonstrates to anyone interested that I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of front-end web development!
